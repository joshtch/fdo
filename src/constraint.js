// A constraint acts as a abstract model in Config from which
// propagators are generated once a space is created. Constraints
// tend to be more concise and reflect the original intend, whereas
// propagators are low level. One constraint can generate multiple
// propagators to do its work, like how sum(A,B,C) breaks down to
// plus(plus(A,B), C) which in turn breaks down to 2x three propagators
// for the plus.
